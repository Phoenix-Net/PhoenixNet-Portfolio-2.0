                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">For a while, I'd been thinking about investing in a 3D printer of some sort. After discussing with some colleagues I decided on an Ender 3 Pro. <br/><br/>
                          It's a solid budget-printer with all the features I wanted straight out of the box. Offering a removable flexible print-bed, and just enough print-area.<br/><br/>
                          I rigged it up to be operable via OctoPrint hosted on the workstation next to it on the workbench. I can effectively control it from anywhere, as well as record timelapses of my prints.<br/><br/>
                          Getting a stable baseline was tricky, but after tons of troubleshooting, I have a solid 3D-printing device for use in the lab, whether it be printing parts, or fun little toys.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">For a while, I had felt that things had "stagnated" in the lab, so I wanted to start a new project. This new project resulted in the addition of VoIP to my lab environment.<br/><br/>
                          I initally invested in some Cisco 7961-GE's to get introduced to VoIP/SIP/PBX and they worked pretty spot-on for a while. I also picked 3CX as my PBX/SIP solution.<br/>
                          After experimenting with what I had, I decided to take it a step further and purchase a SIP Trunk and allow out-bound calling from my lab to further my experiment.<br/><br/>
                          After that, I was introduced to a model of VoIP / Cloud PBX phone called the Cisco Meraki MC74. This phone was a cloud-managed VoIP phone for enterprise networks. I invested in two of them, and began work to integrate them into my lab.<br/><br/>
                          Essentially, they're touchscreen deskphones that run Android, so I can load whatever SIP client I want and connect to my PBX server. The whole process is documented on github <a href="https://github.com/reviveMC74/reviveMC74">here</a>.<br/><br/>
                          The project is still on-going, but so-far it's been a runaway success. I've got both phones successfully connecting to my 3CX PBX Server, and have been actively contributing to the project on Github.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">A month-or-so ago, FreeNAS annouced that they were merging with TrueNAS a seperate project, which is very similar to FreeNAS.<br/><br/>
                          As a result, I had to come up with a plan to migrate from FreeNAS to TrueNAS. I decided my best route would be to do a ZFS replication-based migration from FreeNAS to TrueNAS using the built-in replication tools.<br/>
                          After doing so, I attempted, <em>several times</em>, to migrate my NextCloud install from my FreeNAS VM to my TrueNAS VM, but it kept throwing errors, and was unable to be upgraded, so I ended up rebuilding it entirely.<br/>
                          Another thing that was put into consideration was data-redundancy, and protection. I ended up moving my NAS solution from my R410 to my R710 for RAID-based protection.<br/>
                          In the end, I had upgraded to TrueNAS 12.0 and NextCloud 19, a total success, and no important data was lost in the migration. üëç

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After lengthy planning and strategizing, I had a plan.<br/><br/>
                        Most, if not all, of the patch cables I ran inside the rack connecting the servers to the switch, and connecting the other devices to the network were either ruined, destroyed, or just unfit for reinstallation.<br/>
                        All of the equipment somehow survived, including all the servers, spare networking equipment, and the electrical wiring and circuitry for the rack.<br/>
                        I had to make a decision in regards to how I wanted to re-run, cable, and manage the patch cables on the rack that would be more efficient and cost-effective than last time.<br/><br/>
                        I decided that I would purchase patch cables off Amazon, (Roughly $17/10 10ft Cat-5e, and $15/10 1ft Cat-5e) and also invest in a label printer to label every cable for disassembly/reassembly purposes.<br/>
                        After rewiring the rack, labeling everything, and ensuring cables were secured in a neat and orderly fashion, I was able to effectively bring the lab back to functioning order.<br/>
                        I'm personally pretty happy with how it came out, I now know where each keystone jack goes, the cables are grouped by function and are labled at each end.<br/><br/>
                        Also, that label printer is pretty cool IMHO, totally worth the investment. It prints literally anything and has so many presets.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">And I thought it was just <em>perfect... Until...</em>.<br/><br/>
                        I was over at my partner's house when I had been notified that my basement (The location of the server rack) was slowly flooding with water that had built up from the non-stop rain we had been getting that week.<br/><br/>
                        In response, I immediately returned home and started removing all of my equipment from the installation location in an effort to save it from liquid exposure.<br/>
                        As a result, I practically <em>ripped</em> the equipment out yanking cabling and scattering everything, leaving the lab in complete chaos and unfunctional.<br/><br/>
                        I struggled to get a feasable internet connection using the little equipment I had, but I managed to hack together a 10/100 Wireless N router with DD-WRT on it to patch into our modem downstairs to provide internet to my parents.<br/><br/>
                        As for my lab, I had some work to do to bring it back into service after we corrected the flooding issue...

                        Considering getting that JBOD running, I did the math and it can handle 26TB alltogether if I decided to run it in the lab for additional space.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Shortly after purchasing that rack, I had already ordered a Dell Poweredge R410 from a seller off eBay to start off with. My very first server!</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">With a measly 12GB of DDR3-ECC RAM, an Intel Xeon E5620, and a 500GB HDD I picked up the same day from Microcenter to work with, I had to be very picky with what I ran.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I continued to run the older Dell Inspiron tower for core services like routing, DNS and VPN access below the R410.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I also added some rack-hardware like a keystone panel and a shelf for connecting to drops I had started to install throughout the house.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">A friend of mine who worked in IT messaged me in regards to selling a full-height 43u rack. I had absolutely no idea what I'd do with it, but part of me said <em>do it.</em></p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After getting it downstairs, I had the idea that this was going to be something <strong>BIG.</strong></p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">We all start somewhere right? Well, this is where my story began...</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">It all began with a desktop tower, a Dell Inspiron 580 to be exact. It only had 8GB of RAM, 300GB of space, and an Intel i5 750. (Yes, I upgraded it.)</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Not much to work with here, right? Well, I squeezed every possible resource out of that thing, running pfSense, piHole, OpenVPN, and a NextCloud VM all at once! It was hardly able to keep up with all of that!</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This little dinky thing managed to run all of that, but it was struggling and I wanted <em>More! More space, more power, more everything!</em> So much potential, yet nowhere to utilize it!</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">That sparked something in me that has come to show me exactly what I'm capable of, running my very own homelab with more space than I'd ever need.</p>

# PhoenixNet-Portfolio-2.0
Revamp, up from scratch. Because I was bored in class and felt unsatisfied with the current one.

Hopefully this bad boy will gain some attention with some potential employers, only took me ~ 3-4 hours to whip up the base pages using what I had on 1.0, although I did change the wording / etc. on every page just to be more clear with my messages and what I'm demonstrating.

I also added the ability to blow up images on the front-page since I didn't realize that some people are legally blind and can't see very well apparently. :>
